# RabbitMQ Loaded Docker
This is a "loaded" Docker image for RabbitMQ that contains several plugins that are routinely of use when using [https://masstransit-project.com/](MassTransit). It is based off of the version they maintain, but uses the [https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate/](WhiteSource Renovate Bot) to ensure it gets a version bump every time RabbitMQ releases a new build.

## Usage
`docker pull ghcr.io/chrismeller/rabbitmq:main` for the latest.
